  abstract = {Motivation: The integration of multiple datasets remains a key challenge in systems biology and genomic medicine. Modern highthroughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct\textemdash{}but often complementary\textemdash{}information. We present a Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which we refer to as MDI (Multiple Dataset Integration). MDI can integrate information from a wide range of different datasets and data types simultaneously (including the ability to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian processes). Each dataset is modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture model, with dependencies between these models captured through parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets. Results: Using a set of six artificially constructed time series datasets, we show that MDI is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously, and that it successfully captures the underlying structural similarity between the datasets. We also analyse a variety of real Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. In the two-dataset case, we show that MDI's performance is comparable with the present state-of-the-art. We then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation\textendash{}chip and protein\textendash{}protein interaction data, to identify a set of protein complexes for which genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle. Comparisons to other unsupervised data integration techniques\textemdash{}as well as to non-integrative approaches\textemdash{}demonstrate that MDI is competitive, while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods.},

  volume = {14},
  doi = {10.1101/282269},
  abstract = {Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand
context specific protein function. Some proteins can be found with a single location
within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically relocalise,
or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to
uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS)
based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins
to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods
fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate
the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative
classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to
sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations,
with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm,
as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide
uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics.
Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new
modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively
with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing
more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support
vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using
our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first
Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.},

In this Commentary, we give a brief overview of the different mechanisms that are involved in protein trafficking and describe how aberrant localization of proteins contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases, such as metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cancer. Accordingly, modifying the disease-related subcellular mislocalization of proteins might be an attractive means of therapeutic intervention. In particular, cellular processes that link protein folding and cell signaling, as well as nuclear import and export, to the subcellular localization of proteins have been proposed as targets for therapeutic intervention. We discuss the concepts involved in the therapeutic restoration of disrupted physiological protein localization and therapeutic mislocalization as a strategy to inactivate disease-causing proteins.},

Using both approaches we highlight suborganellar resolution and isoform-specific subcellular niches as well as the locations of large protein complexes and proteins involved in signalling pathways which play important roles in cancer and metabolism.

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

We further apply the method to an experiment on pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells to classify a set of previously unknown proteins, and validate our findings against a recent high resolution map of the mouse stem cell proteome.

  abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of protein subcellular localization assists in the elucidation of protein function and understanding of different biological mechanisms that occur at discrete subcellular niches. Organelle-centric proteomics enables localization of thousands of proteins simultaneously. Although such techniques have successfully allowed organelle protein catalogues to be achieved, they rely on the purification or significant enrichment of the organelle of interest, which is not achievable for many organelles. Incomplete separation of organelles leads to false discoveries, with erroneous assignments. Proteomics methods that measure the distribution patterns of specific organelle markers along density gradients are able to assign proteins of unknown localization based on comigration with known organelle markers, without the need for organelle purification. These methods are greatly enhanced when coupled to sophisticated computational tools. Here we apply and compare multiple approaches to establish a high-confidence data set of Arabidopsis root tissue trans-Golgi network (TGN) proteins. The method employed involves immunoisolations of the TGN, coupled to probability-based organelle proteomics techniques. Specifically, the technique known as LOPIT (localization of organelle protein by isotope tagging), couples density centrifugation with quantitative mass-spectometry-based proteomics using isobaric labeling and targeted methods with semisupervised machine learning methods. We demonstrate that while the immunoisolation method gives rise to a significant data set, the approach is unable to distinguish cargo proteins and persistent contaminants from full-time residents of the TGN. The LOPIT approach, however, returns information about many subcellular niches simultaneously and the steady-state location of proteins. Importantly, therefore, it is able to dissect proteins present in more than one organelle and cargo proteins en route to other cellular destinations from proteins whose steady-state location favors the TGN. Using this approach, we present a robust list of Arabidopsis TGN proteins.},
