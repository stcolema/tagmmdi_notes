  abstract = {Motivation: The integration of multiple datasets remains a key challenge in systems biology and genomic medicine. Modern highthroughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct\textemdash{}but often complementary\textemdash{}information. We present a Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which we refer to as MDI (Multiple Dataset Integration). MDI can integrate information from a wide range of different datasets and data types simultaneously (including the ability to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian processes). Each dataset is modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture model, with dependencies between these models captured through parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets. Results: Using a set of six artificially constructed time series datasets, we show that MDI is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously, and that it successfully captures the underlying structural similarity between the datasets. We also analyse a variety of real Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. In the two-dataset case, we show that MDI's performance is comparable with the present state-of-the-art. We then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation\textendash{}chip and protein\textendash{}protein interaction data, to identify a set of protein complexes for which genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle. Comparisons to other unsupervised data integration techniques\textemdash{}as well as to non-integrative approaches\textemdash{}demonstrate that MDI is competitive, while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods.},

  title = {A {{Bayesian Mixture Modelling Approach For Spatial Proteomics}}},
  volume = {14},
  doi = {10.1101/282269},
  abstract = {Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand
context specific protein function. Some proteins can be found with a single location
within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically relocalise,
or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to
uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS)
based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins
to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods
fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate
the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative
classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to
sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations,
with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm,
as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide
uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics.
Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new
modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively
with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing
more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support
vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using
our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first
Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.},

The appropriate subcellular localization of proteins is crucial because it provides the physiological context for their function. In this Commentary, we give a brief overview of the different mechanisms that are involved in protein trafficking and describe how aberrant localization of proteins contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases, such as metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cancer. Accordingly, modifying the disease-related subcellular mislocalization of proteins might be an attractive means of therapeutic intervention. In particular, cellular processes that link protein folding and cell signaling, as well as nuclear import and export, to the subcellular localization of proteins have been proposed as targets for therapeutic intervention. We discuss the concepts involved in the therapeutic restoration of disrupted physiological protein localization and therapeutic mislocalization as a strategy to inactivate disease-causing proteins.},

We present the most comprehensive high-resolution mass spectrometry-based human dataset to date and deliver a flexible set of subcellular proteomics protocols for sample preparation and data analysis. For the first time, we methodically compare these two different mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics methods within the same study and also apply QSep, the first tool that objectively and robustly quantifies subcellular resolution in spatial proteomics data. Using both approaches we highlight suborganellar resolution and isoform-specific subcellular niches as well as the locations of large protein complexes and proteins involved in signalling pathways which play important roles in cancer and metabolism. Finally, we showcase an extensive analysis of the multilocalising proteome identified via both methods.},

  abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

We demonstrate the utility of our algorithms through evaluation of five experimental datasets, from four different species in conjunction with four different auxiliary data sources to classify proteins to tens of sub-cellular compartments with high generalisation accuracy. We further apply the method to an experiment on pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells to classify a set of previously unknown proteins, and validate our findings against a recent high resolution map of the mouse stem cell proteome.
