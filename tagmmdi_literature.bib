  abstract = {Motivation: The integration of multiple datasets remains a key challenge in systems biology and genomic medicine. Modern highthroughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct\textemdash{}but often complementary\textemdash{}information. We present a Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which we refer to as MDI (Multiple Dataset Integration). MDI can integrate information from a wide range of different datasets and data types simultaneously (including the ability to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian processes). Each dataset is modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture model, with dependencies between these models captured through parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets. Results: Using a set of six artificially constructed time series datasets, we show that MDI is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously, and that it successfully captures the underlying structural similarity between the datasets. We also analyse a variety of real Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. In the two-dataset case, we show that MDI's performance is comparable with the present state-of-the-art. We then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation\textendash{}chip and protein\textendash{}protein interaction data, to identify a set of protein complexes for which genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle. Comparisons to other unsupervised data integration techniques\textemdash{}as well as to non-integrative approaches\textemdash{}demonstrate that MDI is competitive, while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods.},

  volume = {14},
  doi = {10.1101/282269},
  abstract = {Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand
context specific protein function. Some proteins can be found with a single location
within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically relocalise,
or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to
uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS)
based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins
to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods
fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate
the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative
classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to
sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations,
with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm,
as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide
uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics.
Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new
modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively
with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing
more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support
vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using
our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first
Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.},

  abstract = {The eukaryotic cell is organized into membrane-covered compartments that are characterized by specific sets of proteins and biochemically distinct cellular processes. The appropriate subcellular localization of proteins is crucial because it provides the physiological context for their function. In this Commentary, we give a brief overview of the different mechanisms that are involved in protein trafficking and describe how aberrant localization of proteins contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases, such as metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cancer. Accordingly, modifying the disease-related subcellular mislocalization of proteins might be an attractive means of therapeutic intervention. In particular, cellular processes that link protein folding and cell signaling, as well as nuclear import and export, to the subcellular localization of proteins have been proposed as targets for therapeutic intervention. We discuss the concepts involved in the therapeutic restoration of disrupted physiological protein localization and therapeutic mislocalization as a strategy to inactivate disease-causing proteins.},

  abstract = {Hyperplexed Localisation of Organelle Proteins by Isotope Tagging (hyperLOPIT) is a well-established method for studying protein subcellular localisation in complex biological samples. As a simpler alternative we developed a second workflow named Localisation of Organelle Proteins by Isotope Tagging after Differential ultraCentrifugation (LOPIT-DC) which is faster and less resource-intensive. We present the most comprehensive high-resolution mass spectrometry-based human dataset to date and deliver a flexible set of subcellular proteomics protocols for sample preparation and data analysis. For the first time, we methodically compare these two different mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics methods within the same study and also apply QSep, the first tool that objectively and robustly quantifies subcellular resolution in spatial proteomics data. Using both approaches we highlight suborganellar resolution and isoform-specific subcellular niches as well as the locations of large protein complexes and proteins involved in signalling pathways which play important roles in cancer and metabolism. Finally, we showcase an extensive analysis of the multilocalising proteome identified via both methods.},
